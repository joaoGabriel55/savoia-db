# Releasing

Releases are built by `.github/workflows/release.yml` when a `v*` tag is pushed. Why it works this way: see the [packaging ADR](./adr/202610100804-package-with-cargo-packager-and-update-from-github-releases.md).

## One-time setup

1. **Updater key.** The key pair lives in `~/.savoia/` on the maintainer's machine. `updater.key` is the private key, and `updater.key.password` is its password. The public half is committed as `crates/savoia-app/updater.pub`, and tag builds compile it in. Back up `~/.savoia/` outside GitHub: losing the private key strands every installed copy on its version. Store the private half as repository secrets with an account that has admin rights on the repository:

   ```sh
   gh secret set CARGO_PACKAGER_SIGN_PRIVATE_KEY -R joaoGabriel55/savoia-studio < ~/.savoia/updater.key
   gh secret set CARGO_PACKAGER_SIGN_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD -R joaoGabriel55/savoia-studio < ~/.savoia/updater.key.password
   ```

   A tag build fails if these secrets are missing. To rotate the key, generate a new pair with `cargo packager signer generate --path ~/.savoia/updater.key`, commit the new `updater.pub`, and reset both secrets. Copies installed before the rotation can't verify newer releases, so their users must download the new version by hand once.
2. **GitHub Pages.** In Settings › Pages, set the source to *GitHub Actions*. The docs site deploys on the next push to `main` that touches `docs/site/`.
3. **Code signing** is off for v0.1, so macOS and Windows warn on first launch (the install docs explain how to get past it).
   - **macOS:** add the secrets `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (a base64 `.p12`), `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` (an app-specific password) and `APPLE_TEAM_ID`. The workflow signs and notarizes as soon as they exist.
   - **Windows:** needs a certificate (SignPath for open source, or Azure Trusted Signing) and a `signCommand` under `[package.metadata.packager.windows]`.

Pull requests that change packaging build every installer, unsigned, as a check before a tag.

## Each release

Versions and release notes come from [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets); see [the ADR](./adr/202610101305-version-releases-with-changesets.md).

1. **In each PR users will notice,** run `npx changeset` (after `npm ci` once). Pick patch, minor or major and write one line for the changelog, then commit the generated `.changeset/*.md`. CI warns when a PR has none.
2. **After merging to `main`,** the Changesets workflow opens or updates the **Release Savoia Studio** PR. It bumps `package.json`, `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` and writes `CHANGELOG.md`. Review the version and the notes.
3. **Merge the Release PR.** The workflow tags `vX.Y.Z` and starts the release build (about 25 minutes).
4. **Review the draft release:** every installer, the `.sig` files and `latest.json`. Then click **Publish release**. Installed copies see the update only after it is published.

One-time setting: in Settings › Actions › General › Workflow permissions, tick *Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests*, or step 2 can't open the PR.

Don't edit versions by hand: `package.json` is the source and `scripts/sync-version.mjs` copies it into Cargo. To release by hand anyway (for example, to rebuild a tag), run the Release workflow from the Actions tab and choose the tag as the ref.

## Building an installer locally

```sh
cargo install cargo-packager --locked
cd crates/savoia-app
cargo packager --release --formats app,dmg   # or nsis,wix / deb,appimage
```

The packages land in `target/packages/`. Without `SAVOIA_UPDATER_PUBKEY` the build has no update key and never checks for updates.

## Testing an update locally

`SAVOIA_UPDATER_ENDPOINT` replaces the manifest URL at build time, so an older build can update itself from a local server:

1. Generate a throwaway key: `cargo packager signer generate --path /tmp/test.key`.
2. Bump the version to 0.1.1. Build with `SAVOIA_UPDATER_PUBKEY="$(cat /tmp/test.key.pub)"`, `SAVOIA_UPDATER_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8765/latest.json` and the `CARGO_PACKAGER_SIGN_PRIVATE_KEY*` variables set: `cargo packager --release --formats app`.
3. Put the `.app.tar.gz`, its `.sig`, and a `latest.json` from `scripts/release-manifest.py` (with its URLs pointed at the local server) into a folder, and serve it with `python3 -m http.server 8765`.
4. Set the version back to 0.1.0, build the same way without the signing variables, copy the `.app` somewhere, and open it. It offers 0.1.1, and **Install and restart** swaps the bundle.

On 2026-10-10 this worked on macOS. Appending bytes to the served package made it fail with "The signature verification failed", and 0.1.0 stayed installed.
