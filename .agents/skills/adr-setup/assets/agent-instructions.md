## Architecture Decision Records

Architectural decisions are recorded in `<adr-dir>/`, indexed in `<adr-dir>/README.md`.

- Before an architectural change (new dependency, data model, module boundaries, infrastructure, cross-cutting patterns), read the index and the relevant ADRs.
- Follow Accepted ADRs. If a requested change conflicts with one, say so and stop for confirmation instead of silently breaking it.
- When your work makes a decision future developers will need the "why" for, or one that is architecturally significant, cross-team, or hard to reverse, write an ADR:
  - copy `<adr-dir>/template.md` to `<adr-dir>/$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)-<decision-slug>.md`, naming the decision, not the topic;
  - status Proposed unless the user has agreed to it;
  - describe the real context and the alternatives considered, not generic pros and cons;
  - add it to the index.
- Don't write ADRs for tiny, temporary, or already-documented decisions.
- Never edit an existing ADR except its status. To change a decision, write a new ADR and set the old one's status to `Superseded by [title](./file.md)`.
- After adding an ADR or changing a status, regenerate the index table from the files.
